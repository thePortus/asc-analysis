    "Now we've seen the entire network. It may look like a big mess (what some network analysts call \"the spaghetti monster\"), but there are some important details that we can tell right away. For starters, *almost* everything is interconnected! There are but a few near-loners separate from the network. This isn't a given. Many networks are split into highly independent and barely connected sub components. Some networks have components that are totally detacted from any other part of the network. This network has none of those features.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, right away we can tell that the world of charters and elite witnesses was highly interconnected and reciprocal. At the same time, we can also tell that the network is not an even mass of jumbled connections. There are subformations within the larger network. Using \"neighborhood detection\", we have colored this network to represent the mathematical \"guess\" at where the boundaries of major subcomponents of the larger network lie. These different neighborhoods often (but not necessarily) loosely relate to meaningful real world distinctions such as political borders. While it isn't an objective or certain determinant of whether one individual is or is not a member of some real group... it can be a quick way at visualizing major groupings within the whole network.\n",

    "To go farther though, we can look at individuals, and chop up the network into subcomponents."

    "We are going to use several measures to study \"centrality,\" the two most important being degree and betweeness. Degree centrality is simple a measure of which nodes (people) have the most connections. In this case, that means which people have the greatest number of connections to others through acts of witnessing. This can be important, but is hardly the only measure.\n",
    "\n",
    "Betweeness centrality, put simply, measures not only how many \"connections\" one has to others... but how many connections those connections have, and so on. Depending on your needs, this is often more meaningful measure of centrality, since having the *most* friends isn't the same as having *important* friends.\n",
